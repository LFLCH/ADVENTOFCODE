# 🎄 ADVENTOFCODE
📆 <br>Here you can find the code I used for the solving of the little riddles given by the [AdventOfCode plateform](https://adventofcode.com/) <br>
Each day of this advent calendar, two exercises are given : The first one is a very easy problem, and the second one uses data from the exercise 1, but asks for a slightly more difficult problem. <br>
The code you'll see is the code I used for the exercise 2 only. I comment the parts used for the first exercise that are not used after. <br>


🐍 <br> Here I use Python because of its simplicity, but you can use any other language, given the fact that the plateform awaits only a result (the code is neither filed nor run on it).
